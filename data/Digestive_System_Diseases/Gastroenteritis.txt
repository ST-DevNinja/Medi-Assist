Gastroenteritis, often referred to as the “stomach flu,” is an inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily affecting the stomach and intestines. It is a highly common illness worldwide and can affect individuals of all ages. Gastroenteritis is typically caused by viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections and is transmitted through contaminated food or water, person-to-person contact, or poor hygiene.

**Common symptoms of gastroenteritis include**:
- Nausea and vomiting
- Watery diarrhea (often sudden in onset)
- Abdominal cramps or pain
- Bloating and flatulence
- Low-grade fever
- Loss of appetite
- Fatigue and weakness
- Dehydration (especially in children and older adults)
- Headache or muscle aches (in some cases)

**Causes and risk factors**:
- **Viral infections** (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus)
- **Bacterial infections** (e.g., Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shigella)
- **Parasitic infections** (e.g., Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium)
- Consumption of contaminated or undercooked food
- Drinking unsafe water
- Contact with infected individuals or surfaces
- Poor sanitation or hygiene practices
- Weakened immune system

**Diagnosis** is typically based on clinical symptoms but may include:
- Detailed patient history and symptom duration
- Stool sample analysis to detect bacteria, viruses, or parasites
- Blood tests to monitor dehydration or infection markers
- Electrolyte panels to assess fluid imbalance
- Imaging (rare, unless complications are suspected)

**Treatment** focuses primarily on rehydration and symptom control:
- **Oral rehydration solutions (ORS)** or intravenous fluids in severe cases
- **Anti-diarrheal medications** (e.g., loperamide, only under medical supervision)
- **Antiemetic drugs** to control nausea
- **Probiotics** to restore gut flora
- **Antibiotics** only if a bacterial cause is confirmed (not for viral gastroenteritis)
- Rest and light diet (BRAT: bananas, rice, applesauce, toast)

**Prevention strategies include**:
- Frequent handwashing with soap and water
- Drinking clean, filtered, or boiled water
- Avoiding street food and raw or undercooked meat
- Ensuring food is properly refrigerated and cooked
- Disinfecting commonly touched surfaces during outbreaks
- Rotavirus vaccination in children

**When to seek immediate medical care**:
- High fever with diarrhea or vomiting
- Signs of severe dehydration: dry mouth, sunken eyes, reduced urination
- Bloody or black stools
- Persistent vomiting preventing fluid intake
- Symptoms lasting more than 3 days or worsening over time

**Synonyms and related expressions**:
- Stomach flu
- Infectious diarrhea
- Stomach bug
- Vomiting and loose motion
- Intestinal infection
- Acute gastroenteritis
- Traveler’s diarrhea

With early detection and proper hydration, most cases of gastroenteritis resolve within a few days. However, untreated dehydration or complications in high-risk groups (infants, elderly, immunocompromised) can lead to hospitalization. Patient education on hygiene and safe food practices plays a critical role in reducing recurrence and outbreaks.
