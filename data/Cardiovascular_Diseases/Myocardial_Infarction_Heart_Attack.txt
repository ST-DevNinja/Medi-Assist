Myocardial Infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle (myocardium) is abruptly blocked. This blockage—most often caused by a buildup of plaque (atherosclerosis) in the coronary arteries—leads to oxygen deprivation and irreversible damage to the heart tissue if not treated promptly.

**Common symptoms** of a heart attack include:
- Chest pain or pressure (often described as squeezing, tightness, heaviness, or burning)
- Radiating pain to the left arm, jaw, back, or neck
- Shortness of breath
- Cold sweats
- Fatigue
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Nausea or vomiting
- Feeling of impending doom (in some cases)

**Silent myocardial infarctions** (SMIs) can occur without noticeable symptoms and are especially common in individuals with diabetes, the elderly, or those with a high pain threshold.

**Underlying causes and risk factors**:
- Coronary artery disease (CAD)
- Smoking
- High blood pressure (hypertension)
- High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia)
- Diabetes mellitus
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Obesity
- Chronic stress
- Family history of heart disease
- Excessive alcohol consumption

**Diagnosis** typically involves:
- Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) to detect heart rhythm abnormalities
- Cardiac biomarkers such as troponin levels in blood tests
- Echocardiogram or cardiac ultrasound
- Coronary angiography (to visualize blocked arteries)
- Chest X-ray or CT angiography in complex cases

**Immediate treatment** aims to restore blood flow quickly:
- **Pharmacological interventions**:
  - Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel)
  - Thrombolytics (clot-busting drugs)
  - Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or nitrates
  - Statins to control cholesterol
- **Non-pharmacological and interventional procedures**:
  - Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI or angioplasty with stenting)
  - Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery
  - Oxygen therapy and pain relief (e.g., morphine)
  - Lifestyle changes: quitting smoking, dietary modifications, cardiac rehabilitation, stress management

**Complications** of untreated or severe MI can include:
- Heart failure
- Arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms)
- Cardiogenic shock
- Ventricular rupture
- Pericarditis
- Sudden cardiac arrest

**Prognosis** depends on the extent of heart damage, speed of treatment, and post-MI management. Survival rates and long-term outcomes significantly improve with early intervention, medication adherence, and lifestyle change.

**Preventative strategies** include regular health check-ups, managing blood pressure and cholesterol, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, reducing stress, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol.

**Synonyms and related terms**:
- Heart attack
- Cardiac infarction
- Coronary thrombosis
- Coronary occlusion
- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
- Blocked artery
- Chest pain emergency
- Myocardial ischemia
- Silent heart attack
- STEMI / NSTEMI (ST-Elevation MI / Non-ST-Elevation MI)

Public awareness, rapid response (e.g., calling emergency services), and continuous cardiac care are vital in minimizing mortality and complications associated with myocardial infarction.
