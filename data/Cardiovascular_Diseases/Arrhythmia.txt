Arrhythmia, commonly referred to as an irregular heartbeat, is a cardiac condition that disrupts the normal rhythm of the heart. It may present as the heart beating too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or with irregular intervals (fibrillation or flutter). This condition can affect individuals of all ages and is often influenced by lifestyle factors, underlying heart disease, electrolyte imbalances, or genetic predispositions.

Common symptoms of arrhythmia include palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, fainting (syncope), or even anxiety. Some patients may remain asymptomatic and only discover the condition during routine physical exams or diagnostic procedures.

Diagnosis of arrhythmia involves multiple approaches such as:
- ** Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)**: to measure heart electrical activity.
- ** Holter monitor or event recorder**: for long-term rhythm tracking.
- ** Echocardiogram or cardiac MRI**: for heart structure assessment.
- ** Electrophysiological study (EPS)**: for pinpointing the electrical pathways involved.

Risk factors include hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, substance abuse (especially caffeine, alcohol, or stimulants), and high stress levels.

Treatment options vary and may include:
- ** Pharmacological management**: beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic drugs, anticoagulants to prevent stroke.
- ** Non-pharmacological approaches**: catheter ablation, pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation.
- ** Lifestyle modifications**: quitting smoking, reducing caffeine, regular exercise, and stress management.
- ** Surgical options**: in severe or refractory cases.

Early detection and continuous management significantly improve the prognosis and reduce the risk of complications such as stroke, heart failure, or sudden cardiac arrest. Patient education, routine checkups, and adherence to treatment plans are essential in preventing progression.

Other related terms: heart rhythm disorder, irregular pulse, skipped heartbeat, heart palpitations, cardiac dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, bradyarrhythmia.

Arrhythmia is a serious but manageable condition when addressed with a multidisciplinary care approach.
