MediAssist was created as a semester project by three students of BSAI-IV-B at Air University. 
The team includes Saad Tariq, Adeel Alvi, and Hurr Abbas. 
The purpose of MediAssist is to assist users with medical information using AI, ML, and IR techniques. 
If you're wondering who made MediAssist, why it was created, or who the team members are—this document provides those answers.

Purpose:
MediAssist aims to provide users with accurate medical answers using intelligent document retrieval and answer generation. 
It also includes ML-based disease prediction and AI-based triage systems to assist patients in understanding symptoms and finding suitable medical help.

Course Relevance:
- Information Retrieval: Query expansion, FAISS vector search using Sentence Transformers with RAG integration.
- Artificial Intelligence: Rule-based logic and search-based decision support.
- Machine Learning: Disease prediction using trained models on real-world datasets.

MediAssist is designed to simulate a real-world healthcare assistant that merges all aspects of our semester learning into one unified system.
