Typhoid fever, also known simply as typhoid, is a systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Salmonella enterica* serotype Typhi. It primarily affects populations in developing countries with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. Typhoid is a serious public health concern worldwide due to its potential for outbreaks and high morbidity.

**Transmission:**  
Typhoid is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water containing *Salmonella Typhi*. The bacteria multiply in the intestines and spread through the bloodstream to various organs, causing systemic illness.

**Symptoms:**  
Typhoid typically develops 6 to 30 days after exposure and presents with a wide range of symptoms, which may vary depending on individual factors such as age, immune status, and presence of comorbidities. Common symptoms include:  
- Persistent high fever that gradually increases over days  
- Weakness and fatigue  
- Abdominal pain and discomfort  
- Headache  
- Loss of appetite and weight loss  
- Diarrhea or constipation  
- Rose-colored spots (rash) on the trunk  
- Enlarged spleen and liver in some cases  

Complications can occur if untreated, such as intestinal hemorrhage or perforation, which are life-threatening and require urgent medical attention.

**Diagnosis:**  
Diagnosis of typhoid fever is based on a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory tests, including:  
- Blood culture to isolate *Salmonella Typhi* (gold standard)  
- Stool and urine cultures, especially later in the disease  
- Widal test (serological test), though less specific and now less favored  
- Complete blood count may show leukopenia or anemia  
- Imaging studies in complicated cases to assess intestinal integrity  

**Treatment:**  
Early and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial for successful treatment. Common antibiotics used include:  
- Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), although resistance is rising  
- Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone)  
- Azithromycin as an alternative in some cases  

Supportive care involves:  
- Hydration and electrolyte management  
- Nutritional support  
- Monitoring and managing complications such as intestinal perforation or hemorrhage  

Surgery may be necessary in severe cases of intestinal perforation.

**Prevention:**  
Prevention strategies focus on improving sanitation, access to clean water, and food safety. Vaccination is an important preventive measure:  
- Oral live attenuated vaccine (Ty21a)  
- Injectable Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine  

Public health education about hand hygiene, safe food handling, and avoiding contaminated water sources is critical to reduce transmission.

**Prognosis:**  
With prompt diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis of typhoid fever is generally good. Untreated typhoid can be fatal due to severe complications. Early detection and consistent management significantly improve outcomes.

Typhoid remains a significant health burden in many parts of the world, underscoring the need for continued surveillance, vaccination programs, and improvements in water and sanitation infrastructure.
