Arthritis

Arthritis is a broad term referring to inflammation of one or more joints, resulting in pain, swelling, stiffness, and decreased mobility. It encompasses over 100 different conditions that affect the joints and surrounding tissues, with **osteoarthritis (OA)** and **rheumatoid arthritis (RA)** being the most prevalent types. Arthritis can affect people of all ages, though it is more common in older adults.

The impact of arthritis ranges from mild discomfort to severe disability, often interfering with daily activities and quality of life. Early diagnosis and tailored management are key to preventing joint damage and improving outcomes.

Common causes and types of arthritis include:
- **Osteoarthritis (OA)**: Degenerative joint disease caused by gradual wear and tear of cartilage, commonly affecting knees, hips, and hands.
- **Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**: An autoimmune disorder in which the bodyâ€™s immune system attacks joint linings, leading to chronic inflammation and joint deformity.
- **Psoriatic arthritis**: Occurs in individuals with psoriasis, involving joint pain, stiffness, and skin symptoms.
- **Gout**: A metabolic condition resulting from uric acid crystal accumulation in joints, typically affecting the big toe.
- **Infectious arthritis**: Caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections in the joint space.

Symptoms of arthritis can vary by type but commonly include:
- Joint pain that worsens with activity or after periods of rest
- Swelling, warmth, and redness over affected joints
- Morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes (especially in inflammatory arthritis)
- Reduced range of motion and joint function
- Fatigue and general malaise (common in autoimmune forms)

Diagnosis of arthritis involves a combination of clinical evaluation and diagnostic tests:
- Physical examination to assess swelling, tenderness, and joint mobility
- X-rays, MRI, or ultrasound to detect joint damage or inflammation
- Blood tests for inflammatory markers (e.g., ESR, CRP), rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP antibodies
- Joint aspiration to analyze synovial fluid in suspected gout or infections

Treatment strategies depend on the type and severity of arthritis:
1. Pharmacological management:
   - **NSAIDs** (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) for pain and inflammation relief
   - **Corticosteroids** (oral or injectable) to reduce acute flare-ups
   - **DMARDs** (e.g., methotrexate, sulfasalazine) for autoimmune types like RA
   - **Biologic agents** (e.g., TNF inhibitors) for moderate-to-severe RA and psoriatic arthritis
   - **Urate-lowering therapy** (e.g., allopurinol) for gout

2. Non-pharmacological approaches:
   - Physical therapy and low-impact exercises to preserve joint function
   - Weight loss to reduce joint strain
   - Use of supportive devices (e.g., braces, orthotics)
   - Application of heat or cold packs to relieve symptoms

3. Surgical intervention (in advanced or unresponsive cases):
   - Arthroscopic debridement or synovectomy
   - Joint fusion (arthrodesis)
   - **Total joint replacement** (e.g., knee, hip, or shoulder arthroplasty)

When to seek medical attention:
- Persistent joint pain, swelling, or stiffness not relieved by rest or medications
- Difficulty performing daily tasks due to joint discomfort
- Suspected autoimmune symptoms (e.g., symmetrical joint pain, fatigue, low-grade fever)
- Sudden onset of joint pain with redness and fever (possible septic arthritis or gout)

Prevention and lifestyle strategies:
- Engage in regular, joint-friendly physical activity (e.g., swimming, walking)
- Maintain a healthy weight to ease joint pressure
- Avoid joint overuse and practice ergonomic movements
- Manage chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, psoriasis) that increase arthritis risk
- Early treatment adherence to prevent progression and joint damage

Prognosis:
While there is no cure for most forms of arthritis, many patients can achieve symptom control and maintain active lifestyles with proper treatment. Early and aggressive intervention, especially in autoimmune arthritis, is essential for preserving joint integrity and function.

Keywords and related terms:
- Osteoarthritis (OA)
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
- Joint inflammation
- Autoimmune joint disease
- Synovitis
- DMARDs and biologics
- Gout and uric acid crystals

Patient education is crucial in arthritis management. Understanding the nature of the disease, recognizing early warning signs, adhering to treatment plans, and adopting healthy lifestyle habits can significantly improve long-term outcomes and reduce disability.
