Sciatica

Sciatica is a condition characterized by pain radiating along the sciatic nerve, which extends from the lower back through the hips and down each leg. It typically affects one side of the body.

Causes:
- Herniated or bulging disc pressing on the sciatic nerve
- Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine)
- Piriformis syndrome (muscle irritation)
- Degenerative disc disease
- Trauma or tumors (rarely)

Symptoms:
- Sharp or burning pain from lower back to leg
- Numbness or tingling in leg or foot
- Muscle weakness in the affected limb
- Worsened pain when sitting, coughing, or sneezing

Diagnosis:
- Clinical evaluation of symptoms and reflexes
- MRI or CT scan to identify nerve compression
- Electromyography (EMG) to evaluate nerve function

Treatment:
- Pain relief with NSAIDs or muscle relaxants
- Physical therapy and stretching exercises
- Corticosteroid injections
- Surgery (microdiscectomy or laminectomy) in severe or persistent cases

Recovery:
- Most cases resolve within weeks with conservative care
- Proper posture, regular exercise, and ergonomics help prevent recurrence

Emergency Symptoms:
- Loss of bowel/bladder control
- Progressive leg weakness or numbness
